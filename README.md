# Experimental-Analysis-on-COVID-19-Radiography-Database
The "Experimental Analysis on COVID-19 Radiography Database" project is focused on using advanced machine learning techniques to detect COVID-19 from radiographic images, such as chest X-rays. The project primarily involves the development and evaluation of deep learning models, specifically MobileNetV2 and DenseNet121, which were fine-tuned using transfer learning to classify images into categories like COVID-19, Viral Pneumonia, Normal, and Lung Opacity.
The project begins with extensive data preprocessing, including steps like normalization, resizing, and augmentation of the X-ray images to enhance the performance of the models. After preparing the data, the models are trained and validated to ensure high accuracy in detecting COVID-19 cases. Throughout the project, ethical considerations such as data privacy, model transparency, and bias mitigation are emphasized to ensure responsible AI use in medical diagnostics.
The analysis concludes with a comprehensive evaluation of the models' performance, achieving over 93% accuracy, and includes detailed visualizations like confusion matrices and ROC curves to interpret the model outputs effectively. This project demonstrates the potential of AI in assisting with the early diagnosis of COVID-19, providing a valuable tool for healthcare professionals.
